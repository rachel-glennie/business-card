	<h2>About Me

	<h3>Education</h3>
	<p>I’m a second year graphic design student at Algonquin College. From a young age, I was fascinated by the power of spoken word and visual communication - it’s no surprise that I’ve made a combination of the two and made graphic design my passion and career.</p>

	<h3>Areas of Focus</h3>
	<p>I’m interested in all areas of the world of graphic design - I’m still discovering how vast it is. I’m especially excited to design websites and use hand lettering and fonts.</p>

	<h3>Outside Interests</h3>
	<p>When I’m not working on design, I spend my time reading books, playing various video games, experimenting with photography, watching Eastern animations, making silly crafts of felt and paint, and enjoying the outdoors.</p>
